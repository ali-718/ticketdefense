You are presumed innocent. The state must make a clear and convincing case against you. If the officer omits a small detail, is too vague, or contradicts themself, you can win. If the ticket itself is defective or contradictory, you can win.
 
We know the law, the cops, and the judges. We use the system to our advantage, putting you in the best position to win. That\'s how you get a traffic ticket dismissed. 
 
The best way to win in traffic court is to hire a savvy, experienced New York City traffic ticket attorney.

Fighting to Protect Your Driving Record
 
Many people don’t realize that it’s possible to successfully fight a traffic ticket. Most will simply pay the fine without realizing the full extent of penalties they face. In New York, however, many traffic violation convictions result in points on your driving record. Any number of points can lead to higher auto insurance rates, and with six points on your license, you will be required to pay driver’s assessment fees to the state. At 11 points, your driver’s license could be suspended. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not difficult to rack up a high number of points; a single traffic ticket for cell phone use could lead to as much as five points on your license.
 
Hire us today and submit your ticket(s) and details on the platform. 
 
We will communicate with you as we handle and dispute your ticket(s).
